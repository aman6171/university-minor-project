Use of ethanol with gasoline as a fuel in SI engines. 
Study is based on the parameters and emission characteristics of ethanol when mixed with gasoline to be used as a fuel in Spark Ignition Engine.
1. Performance parameters i.e. Brake Power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Indicated Power, Indicated Thermal Efficiency, Mechanical Efficiency, Brake specific energy consumption (bsec) with using ethanol gasoline (20% and 30%) blends and comparison with pure gasoline.
2. Emission characteristics i.e. carbon dioxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and NOx emission with ethanol gasoline blends and comparison with pure gasoline.
